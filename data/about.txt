I am a graduate student at Penn State University. I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 
I am being advised by Dr. Raj Acharya and Dr. Paul Medvedev. I expect to graduate in May 2017.

I am presently a Tech Intern in Business Insider for the Summer. I am working on two projects - 
1) Chart Building Tool for editors
2) Making a Web App for the internal analytics
